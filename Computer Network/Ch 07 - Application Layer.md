# Chapter 7: Application Layer

The **Application Layer** (Layer 7 of the OSI model) is the closest to the end user. It provides protocols and services that enable applications to communicate over a network. This chapter covers the essential protocols—HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, POP3/IMAP, DNS, DHCP—and the core concepts of client‑server architecture, URL structure, cookies, and sessions.

---

## 1. Client‑Server Architecture

**Definition**: A distributed application structure that partitions tasks between *service providers* (servers) and *service requesters* (clients).

- **Client** – initiates contact, waits for replies, runs on user devices.
- **Server** – always on, listens for requests, provides responses, often serves many clients simultaneously.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Web Client (Browser)
    participant Server as Web Server
    Client->>Server: 1. Request (e.g., GET /index.html)
    Server-->>Client: 2. Response (HTML, status 200)
    Note over Client,Server: Client always initiates and server never contacts client first
```

**Example**:  
- **Client**: Your smartphone’s weather app.  
- **Server**: A cloud‑hosted weather API (e.g., `api.weather.com`). The app requests current temperature, the server replies with JSON data.

---

## 2. URL Structure (Uniform Resource Locator)

A URL is a specific string that identifies a resource and tells the client *how* to access it.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[scheme] --> B["://"]
    B --> C[userinfo]
    C --> D[host]
    D --> E[port]
    E --> F[path]
    F --> G[query]
    G --> H[fragment]
```

**Components (with real example)**  
`https://alice:[email protected]:443/search?q=mermaid&lang=en#results`

| Component | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **scheme** | `https` | Protocol to use (HTTP over TLS) |
| **user:password** | `alice:secret` | Authentication (rarely used in browsers) |
| **host** | `docs.example.com` | Domain name or IP address |
| **port** | `443` | TCP port (default for HTTPS) |
| **path** | `/search` | Resource location on server |
| **query** | `q=mermaid&lang=en` | Key‑value parameters (dynamic content) |
| **fragment** | `results` | Section inside the HTML page (client‑side only) |

> **Note**: In practice, credentials in URLs are deprecated for security reasons.

---

## 3. Cookies and Sessions

HTTP is **stateless** – each request is independent. Cookies and sessions add state.

### 3.1 Cookies
Small text files stored by the browser and sent automatically with every request to the same domain.

**How it works**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant B as Browser
    participant S as Server
    B->>S: POST /login
    S-->>B: Set-Cookie id=abc
    Note over B: store cookie
    B->>S: GET /dashboard with cookie
    S-->>B: dashboard page
```

**Key attributes**:
- `Expires` / `Max‑Age` – lifetime.
- `Domain` / `Path` – scope.
- `Secure` – only send over HTTPS.
- `HttpOnly` – prevents JavaScript access (mitigates XSS).

### 3.2 Sessions
A **session** is server‑side storage tied to a unique session ID (usually stored in a cookie). The server keeps user data (e.g., shopping cart, login state) and the client only holds the identifier.

**Example**:  
- User adds items to cart → session ID `xyz` stores `{cart: ["laptop","mouse"]}` on server.  
- Next request includes `Cookie: sessionId=xyz` → server retrieves the cart.

---

## 4. HTTP / HTTPS

### HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
- **Port**: 80 (plain text).
- **Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- **Status codes**: 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error.

**Basic HTTP exchange**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Browser
    participant Server as Web Server

    Client->>Server: GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\nAccept: text/html
    Server-->>Client: HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html\n\n<html>...
```

### HTTPS (HTTP Secure)
- **Port**: 443.
- Adds **TLS/SSL** encryption between client and server.
- Prevents eavesdropping, tampering, and impersonation.

**Simplified TLS handshake**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Client->>Server: ClientHello (supported ciphers)
    Server-->>Client: ServerHello + Certificate (public key)
    Client->>Server: Verify certificate, generate premaster secret (encrypted with server's public key)
    Server-->>Client: Finished (encrypted)
    Note over Client,Server: Now both have session keys for symmetric encryption
    Client->>Server: HTTP request (encrypted)
    Server-->>Client: HTTP response (encrypted)
```

**Real‑world example**: Banking websites, e‑commerce (Amazon, eBay) – always use HTTPS to protect credentials and payment data.

---

## 5. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

- **Ports**: 20 (data) & 21 (control).
- **Purpose**: Transfer files between client and server.
- **Authentication**: Username/password (or anonymous).

**FTP has two modes**:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Active Mode
        C1[Client port 21] -->|Control| S1[Server port 21]
        S1 -->|Data| C2[Client port 20]
    end
    subgraph Passive Mode
        C3[Client port 21] -->|Control| S2[Server port 21]
        C3 -->|Data| S3[Server high port]
    end
```

**Common FTP commands**:
- `USER`, `PASS` – login.
- `RETR filename` – download.
- `STOR filename` – upload.
- `LIST` – list directory.

**Example**: A web developer uploads website files to a hosting server using FileZilla (FTP client) to `ftp.example.com`.

> **Note**: FTP is insecure (passwords sent in plain text). SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or FTPS (FTP over TLS) are preferred.

---

## 6. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

- **Port**: 25 (standard), 587 (submission), 465 (SMTPS).
- **Purpose**: Send email from client to server, and between mail servers.
- **Direction**: Push protocol (client pushes email to server).

**Email flow using SMTP**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UA as User Agent (Outlook)
    participant MSA as Mail Submission Agent (SMTP server)
    participant MTA as Mail Transfer Agent (relay)
    participant MDA as Mail Delivery Agent

    UA->>MSA: SMTP (HELO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, DATA)
    MSA->>MTA: SMTP (forward email)
    MTA->>MDA: SMTP (deliver to recipient's mailbox)
    Note over MDA: Email stored for retrieval via POP3/IMAP
```

**Example SMTP session**:
```
HELO mail.example.com
MAIL FROM: <[email protected]>
RCPT TO: <[email protected]>
DATA
Subject: Meeting

Tomorrow at 10 AM.
.
QUIT
```

---

## 7. POP3 / IMAP (Email Retrieval)

Both are **pull protocols** – the client retrieves emails from the server.

| Feature | POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3) | IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) |
|---------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Port | 110 (plain), 995 (SSL) | 143 (plain), 993 (SSL) |
| Email storage | Downloads and usually deletes from server | Keeps emails on server, synchronises across devices |
| Folder support | No (only Inbox) | Yes (multiple folders) |
| Offline access | Yes (emails stored locally) | Limited (requires sync) |

**Typical workflow**:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Email arrives at server] --> B[Which protocol]
    B --> C[POP3 Client downloads all emails]
    C --> D[Emails deleted from server default]
    B --> E[IMAP Client views headers only]
    E --> F[Emails stay on server]
    F --> G[Changes mirrored across devices]
```

**Example**:  
- **POP3** used in legacy setups where you read email only from one computer.  
- **IMAP** used by Gmail, Outlook.com, and corporate environments (access from phone, laptop, webmail all stay in sync).

---

## 8. DNS (Domain Name System)

- **Port**: 53 (UDP for queries, TCP for zone transfers).
- **Purpose**: Translates human‑readable domain names (e.g., `google.com`) to IP addresses (e.g., `142.250.190.46`).

**DNS resolution steps**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as Browser
    participant Resolver as Local DNS Resolver
    participant Root as Root DNS Server
    participant TLD as TLD Server (.com)
    participant Auth as Authoritative Server (example.com)

    User->>Resolver: Query: www.example.com ?
    Resolver->>Root: Ask for .com TLD
    Root-->>Resolver: Refer to .com TLD server
    Resolver->>TLD: Ask for example.com
    TLD-->>Resolver: Refer to authoritative ns.example.com
    Resolver->>Auth: Ask for www.example.com
    Auth-->>Resolver: IP = 93.184.216.34
    Resolver-->>User: IP address
```

**Record types**:
- **A** – IPv4 address.
- **AAAA** – IPv6 address.
- **CNAME** – alias (e.g., `www` → `@`).
- **MX** – mail exchange server.

**Example**: When you type `https://github.com`, your computer asks DNS: “Where is github.com?” → receives `140.82.112.3`.

---

## 9. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

- **Port**: 67 (server), 68 (client).
- **Purpose**: Automatically assigns IP addresses, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers to devices on a network.

**DORA process** (Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as DHCP Client (Laptop)
    participant Server as DHCP Server

    Client->>Server: DHCPDISCOVER (broadcast, "I need an IP")
    Server-->>Client: DHCPOFFER ("You can use 192.168.1.100 for 24h")
    Client->>Server: DHCPREQUEST ("I accept 192.168.1.100")
    Server-->>Client: DHCPACK ("Confirmed, here are DNS, gateway")
    Note over Client: Configures IP, subnet mask, gateway, DNS
```

**Lease time**: The IP is valid only for a limited time (e.g., 24 hours). Client renews before expiry.

**Example**: When you connect to a coffee shop Wi‑Fi, your phone uses DHCP to obtain an IP address like `192.168.0.15`, along with the router’s IP as gateway and the ISP’s DNS servers.

## Final Notes

- The **Application Layer** hides the complexity of lower layers (transport, network, data link, physical) from end‑user applications.
- **Client‑server** is the dominant model, but peer‑to‑peer (P2P) also exists (e.g., BitTorrent).
- **Security** is increasingly embedded at this layer (HTTPS, SMTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, DNSSEC).

Understanding these protocols and concepts is essential for anyone building, using, or troubleshooting modern networks and the web.
